# Subway-Station
A subway station project was created by defining a module that uses a seven segment display as output, a 1-bit clk as input, a 1-bit switch_yon module that determines the direction of the metro, and a 6-bit switch_first module that determines the first position of the metro.
The stations reached by scrolling on the seven segments are shown.
